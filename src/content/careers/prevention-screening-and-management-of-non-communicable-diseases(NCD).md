**Benefits:**

- **Reduced Risk of NCDs:** Lifestyle interventions and early detection can help reduce the risk of NCDs.
- **Improved Quality of Life:** Early diagnosis and management of NCDs can improve the quality of life for individuals affected by these conditions.
- **Reduced Mortality:** Early detection and treatment can reduce mortality rates associated with NCDs.
- **Reduced Healthcare Costs:** Early prevention and management can help reduce the long-term costs associated with NCDs.
