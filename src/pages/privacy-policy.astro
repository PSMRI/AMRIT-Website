            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              Welcome to AMRIT ("we", "our", "us"). AMRIT (Accessible Medical Records via Integrated Technologies) is a digital health platform developed by Piramal Swasthya to empower frontline health workers and support interoperable health record systems. We are committed to protecting the privacy and security of personal data of individuals ("you", "your", "data subject") whose information is collected or processed in connection with our platform. This Policy describes how we collect, use, disclose, store, and protect your information, and your rights in relation to that information.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Scope & Applicability</h2>
            <p>
              This policy applies to all personal data that we process via the AMRIT platform, whether you access the service via our website or apps, or as a beneficiary, frontline health worker, healthcare organization or partner.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are outside India, this policy still applies in so far as AMRIT processes your data (and will take into account applicable laws of your jurisdiction to the extent relevant).
            </p>

            <h2>3. What Data We Collect</h2>
            <p>
              We collect and process the following categories of data as part of our platform operations:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Patient / beneficiary identifiers (e.g., ABHA ID, name, date of birth, gender)</li>
              <li>Health records and clinical data (diagnoses, treatments, visit records, medications)</li>
              <li>Contact information (phone number, email, address)</li>
              <li>Health worker / user account information (role, organization, login credentials)</li>
              <li>Usage and device data (device identifiers, IP address, application usage logs)</li>
              <li>Consent records and audit trails</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We collect only the minimum amount of data necessary for the specified purpose (data minimization).
            </p>

            <h2>4. Purpose of Processing</h2>
            <p>

            <ul>
              <li>To enable access to and management of patients' electronic health records through the AMRIT platform</li>
              <li>To support frontline health workers in providing care, by providing relevant patient history and decision-support tools</li>
              <li>To ensure interoperability with national systems such as ABDM (Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission) and other health information systems.</li>
              <li>To comply with applicable regulatory, legal or reporting obligations</li>
              <li>To improve our services, analytics, research (with anonymized/de-identified data)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Data will not be used or processed for any purpose other than those specified, unless further consent is obtained or permitted under law.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Legal Basis & Applicable Laws</h2>
            <p>
              We process your personal data in accordance with applicable laws and best practices. For operations in India, the primary applicable legal frameworks include the Indian IT Act 2000 (and associated Rules) and the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 ("DPDP Act").
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, we commit to complying with cross-jurisdictional data protection norms, including (by way of example) the GDPR (European Union) and COPPA (US) in scenarios where they may be applicable.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are a user in any other jurisdiction, we will apply the law relevant to that jurisdiction as applicable.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Data Sharing, Disclosure & International Transfers</h2>
            <p>
              We may share your data with:
